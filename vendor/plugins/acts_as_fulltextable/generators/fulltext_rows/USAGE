Description:
    The fulltext_rows generator creates a migration to create the
    table needed to use acts_as_fulltextable.
    It takes a list of models for which the index should be created.
    Make sure the models you're passing the generator include a call
    to acts_as_fulltextable before you run it.

Example:
    ./script/generate fulltext_rows model1 model2 model3

    Then run: rake db:migrate
